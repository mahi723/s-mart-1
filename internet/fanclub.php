					<p class="fan-source">So, while this is a silly and fake tribute page the movie Army of Darkness (and/or the Evil Dead series), the franchise does have quite a large cult following. Mostly for all things "Bruce Campbell" but Army of Darkness and Evil Dead is by far his most prominent work that started it all. So, if you already know about Army of Darkness and/or Evil Dead or not you can find a few real fan sites below to help you learn more. Thanks for visiting S-Mart!</p>

					<p class="fan-source"><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/" target="_blank"/>Army of Darkness IMDB</a> - Of course, we cannot have a tribute page to a movie without supplying a link to its Internet Movie Database page. Here you will find film information, cast information, some movie related trivia, and a handful of other interesting goodies about the film.</p>

					<p class="fan-source"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Darkness" target="_blank"/>Army of Darkness Wikipedia</a> - Since we gave you the IMDB link, we wanted to include the Army of Darkness Wikipedia page as well. The information found here will basically be a repetition of the IMDB information, but it is laid out in a more straight-forward, readable format.</p>

					<p class="fan-source"><a href="http://www.bruce-campbell.com/" target="_blank"/>Bruce Campbell Official Site</a> - First and foremost, the official online presence of Bruce Campbell. Here you can find authentic, reliable information about upcoming projects, appearances, press events, filmography, tour dates, and Bruce Campbell shopping.</p>

					<p class="fan-source"><a href="http://www.deadites.net/" target="_blank">Deadites Online</a> - This seems to be the official fan site for all things Army of Darkness/Evil Dead. You can find various literature about the movies, news updates about the franchise(s), character histories/backgrounds, an online store, and even a forum for fans.</p>

					<p class="fan-source"><a href="https://evildeadfanclub.com/" target="_blank"/>Evil Dead Fan Club</a> - This site seems to be a great source for all of your Army of Darkness/Evil Dead purchasing needs. They have great shirts and hoodies, comic books, phone cases, and other accessories.</p>

					<p class="fan-source"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groovybruce" target="_blank"/>Bruce Campbell Facebook</a> - There is a facebook page for Army of Darkness, but, unfortunately, it doesn't appear to get much traffic. So we are including a link to the official Bruce Campbell facebook instead.</p>
